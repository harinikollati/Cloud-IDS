# Secure Cloud Intrusion Detection System

This project implements a Secure Cloud-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
using Deep Learning and Post-Quantum Cryptography.

## Key Features
- Deep Learning IDS (TensorFlow Keras)
- Benign vs Attack traffic classification
- Post-Quantum + AES encrypted log transmission
- Cloud-side decryption and attack detection
- Real-time alert generation
- Evaluation using confusion matrix and metrics

## Deployment
This application is deployed using Streamlit Community Cloud.
All encryption, transmission, and detection operations are executed
on a remote cloud server.

## Note
Large datasets and runtime-generated files are intentionally excluded
from version control due to size and security considerations.
